# Mobile_Price_Classification

The objective of this project is to train different machine learning and deep learning models of the **mobile price classification model** from the ***Kaggle datasets*** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification).

We start by developing the file: **mobile.ipynb**, in which we run different machine learning models using an open source machine learning library called ***Scikit-learn***
(https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and ***XGBoost*** (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
The best prediction found among all models is with the Tuned XGBoost model.

In a second stage we carry out Deep Learning models in the file called: **deep_learning_mobile.ipynb** in which case a better prediction was obtained
